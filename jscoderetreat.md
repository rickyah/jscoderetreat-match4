1. Building up dev environment (10m)
    1. Setup github repo
    2. Install Browser sync
    3. Install jasmine testing framework

2. Milestones

    1. Minimum Viable Game (Total: 4h 30m man/hours)
        - complete game allowing two human players to play
        - no animations in the view
        - start - play - win/draw states 
        - jquery and css for view, and plain js for logic
        

    2. Player Vs Machine (rough estimation: 2 days)
        - Research and Implement IA
        - Animations and UI polish

    3. Future improvements (not estimated)
        1. Add Animations / better ui
        2. Choose player name
        3. Choose player color
        4. IA difficulty
        5. Different board sizes / different win conditions (3-match, 5-match)
        6. Real time PvP multiplayer!
