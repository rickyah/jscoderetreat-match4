#Super awesome hyper dimensional match Four!


### Goal of the project: create a  match 4 game playable in real time




2. Milestones

    1. Minimum Viable Game (Total: 5 man/hours)
        
        - complete game allowing two human players to play
        - no animations in the view
        - start - play - win/draw states 
        - jquery and css for view, and plain js for logic
        -  Building up dev environment
        

    2. Player Vs Machine (rough estimation: 2 days)
        - Research and Implement IA
        - Animations and UI polish

    3. Future improvements if the MVP works (not estimated)
        4. Real time PvP multiplayer!
        1. Add Animations / better ui
        2. Choose player name
        3. Choose player color
        4. IA difficulty
        5. Different board sizes / different win conditions (3-match, 5-match)
        6. Scores and leaderboards

**Building up dev environment** (30m)

  1. Setup git repo (GitHub)
  2. Segup local dev server (Browser sync)
  3. Setup testing framework (jasmine)

**Model** 2h

- board logic and API

**View** 1h 30m

- Rendering the model on screen
- Hook to input events and pass it to the controller

**Controller** 2h

- Handling input 
- Handling states of the game (which player is playing the next move)
- Setting up the model & view communication
